CS 230 Module Eight Journal

The Gaming Room aims to expand their Android game, Draw It or Lose It, to run on Linux, Mac, Windows, and mobile devices. They want the game to be available as a web app that can support thousands of players while ensuring it works smoothly across different platforms and browsers. Key requirements include keeping development costs reasonable and ensuring the game is secure and scalable.

In developing the documentation, I organized the information clearly, which helped clarify the projectâ€™s requirements and design constraints. This process was valuable for understanding how different components would interact, making it easier to implement the features in code later. In future projects, I would utilize techniques like user stories and prototyping to better capture user needs, ensuring the final product is functional and user-friendly.
